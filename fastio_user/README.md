# Fast Packet IO library in User Space (fastio_user) #

This library is developed for **prototyping** high-performance Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) with data plane
frameworks in the Linux's **user space**. Since this library is used for my PhD research and teaching purposes, it focus
on the **simplicity**.

fastio_user currently focuses on providing DPDK C wrappers that can be used to speed up packet I/O and processing with
more programmer friendly APIs and utility functions.

## Build Shared Library ##

In order to simplify and the build process on different platforms. The Docker container is suggested to build the
library (To avoid "I could not build this on my laptop due to dependency errors etc"). There is a
[Dockerfile](./Dockerfile.dpdk) and a [bash script](./util/run_dev_container.sh) to automate the build process. Make
sure you have Docker CE installed. The container image and shared library (.so file) can be built with following steps.
(Because the DPDK is compiled from the source code, the step of build the container image takes time, -j can be modified
in the Dockerfile to speed up the compiling time.)

```bash
$ cd ./util/
# Build the DPDK development container
$ ./run_dev_container.sh -b
# Run make INSIDE the development container
$ ./run_dev_container.sh -m
```

By default, the compiled shared library (libfastio_user.so) is placed in ./build/ directory.

## Dependencies ##

The dependencies are planned to managed by the Dockerfile. The versions are marked here clearly to avoid confusion.

- DPDK: v18.11 LTS

## Documentation ##

The documentation is generated by [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/). Build and open the HTML documents with:

```bash
$ make -f ./Makefile.dev docs
$ xdg-open docs/html/index.html
```

## Reference Frameworks ##

Some tricks and low level optimizations are learned from several high-performance packet I/O and processing frameworks
and integrated into fastio_user. These frameworks are awesome, but are relative too heavy, hide many tunable parameters
or have some limitations to simply integrated with data processing frameworks (e.g. Using OpenCV's python bindings to
process images easily). Therefore, I have built this light library.
