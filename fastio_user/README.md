# Fast Packet IO library in User Space #

This library is developed for **low-level prototyping** and **teaching** innovative and high-performance Virtualized
Network Functions (VNFs) with data plane frameworks in the Linux's **user space**. Since this library is used for my PhD
research and teaching purposes, it focus on the **simplicity** and **easy-to-use**. It can be used by a container
running inside a VM. So experiments can be perform in a lightweight container-based emulator (e.g.
[ComNetsEmu](https://bitbucket.org/comnets/comnetsemu/src/master/)) on **single** laptop.

According to the SDN/NFV design, this network function is responsible to handle ONLY a subset of flows that are filtered
and redirected by the virtual switches. Compared to the filtering/routing/redirecting functions provided by virtual
switch, these VNFs perform more complex tasks that require more computational power like DPI, NAT, video transcoding or
payload compression etc.  The FastIO User supported VNFs should only handle **virtual** network interfaces (like
virtio-user, vhost, veth, tun/tap etc.).

FastIO User currently focuses on providing DPDK C wrappers (plan to add go bindings) that can be used to speed up packet
I/O and processing with more programmer friendly APIs and utility functions. It is designed for evaluating/benchmarking
latest features of DPDK, and fast prototyping novelty VNF ideas in a virtualized environment. It is not developed for
complex VNFs, VNFs utilizing many hardware features, or production usage, use good frameworks like
[NFF-GO](https://github.com/intel-go/nff-go), [libmoon](https://github.com/libmoon/libmoon) or
[Netbricks](https://github.com/NetSys/NetBricks) instead.

## Build Shared Library ##

In order to simplify and the build process on different platforms. The Docker container is suggested to build the
library. There is a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and a [Python3 script](./util/run_dev_container.py) to automate the build
process. Make sure you have Docker CE installed. The container image and shared library (.so file) can be built with
following steps.  (Because the DPDK is compiled from the source code, the step of build the container image takes time,
-j can be modified in the Dockerfile to speed up the compiling time.)

```bash
$ cd ./util/
# Build the DPDK development docker container image
$ ./run_dev_container.py build_image
# Run make INSIDE the development container
$ ./run_dev_container.py build_lib
```

By default, the compiled shared library (libfastio_user.so) is placed in ./build/ directory.

## Dependencies ##

The dependencies are planned to managed by the Dockerfile. The versions are marked here clearly to avoid confusion.

- DPDK: v18.11 LTS

## Tests and Examples ##

DPDK should be configured properly before running tests and examples. Detailed setup guide can be found in the DPDK's
official [quick start setup guide](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/quick_start.html). FastIO User's tests and
examples use a run.sh script with AF_PACKET driver configured for the device. No device binding is required. The
hugepages can be created by running `sudo ./util/setup_hugepage.sh`. By default, 1GB hugepages is allocated.

**MARK**: All required setups are automatically configured for the VNF VM described in ../Vagrantfile after each boot:
`vagrant up vnf`. So you can run tests and examples in this development VM directly after boot.

- Run tests in the development container (without interaction) with:

```bash
$ cd ./util/
# Run development container in interactive mode
$ ./run_dev_container.py run_test
```
