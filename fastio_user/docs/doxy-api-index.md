# Fast Packet IO library in User Space (fastio_user) #

This library is developed for **prototyping** and **teaching** high-performance Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs)
with data plane frameworks in the Linux's **user space**. Since this library is used for my PhD research and teaching
purposes, it focus on the **simplicity**.

Check the [README page](@ref README.md) to get started.
