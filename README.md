# Build VNF #

Try different packet processing tools to build simple Virtualized Network Function (VNFs) in virtual machines or
containers. The main concern of performance is the **low latency**.

Such VNFs should be latter integrated into the [SFC-Ostack](https://github.com/stevelorenz/sfc-ostack) framework.

## Packet Processing Tool ##

- Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)
- IO Visor Project: eBPF + XDP
- Click Modular Router
- User-space NIC Driver (TBD)
