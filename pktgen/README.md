# Packet Generator mainly for Latency Measurement #

## Socket API Based ##

- [Sockperf](https://github.com/mellanox/sockperf): Socket-based latency benchmark tool.

## DPDK-Based ##

- [MoonGen](https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen): MoonGen is a fully scriptable high-speed packet generator. It uses
    hardware features (e.g. timestamping) for accurate and precise latency measurements and rate control.

- [Trex](https://github.com/cisco-system-traffic-generator/trex-core): TRex (From Cisco) is a traffic generator for
    Stateful and Stateless use cases.
