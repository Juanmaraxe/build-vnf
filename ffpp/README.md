# FFPP - Fast Fast Packet Processing #

## Introduction ##

This library is developed for **fast prototyping** and **teaching** high performance packet processing inside Linux containers.
To be utilized low-level technologies including:

-   [DPDK](https://www.dpdk.org/): Fast packet processing in user space.
-   [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp): Fast network data path in the Linux kernel.

FFPP currently focuses on providing DPDK C wrappers (plan to add Rust bindings) that can be used to speed up packet I/O
and processing with more programmer-friendly APIs and utility functions.
C is chosen here mainly due to the fact that the DPDK library is developed in C, so it's easier to utilize all its
functionalities and newly added features via C APIs.
I prefer safer languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Unfortunately, DPDK currently does not provide official Rust bindings.
There is a user space driver written in Rust called [ixy.rs](https://github.com/ixy-languages/ixy.rs).
DPDK is currently chosen mainly due to [its support](http://core.dpdk.org/supported/) for common paravirtualization and
software NICs, high performance as well as comprehensive development documentation.

Since this library is used for my PhD research and teaching purposes, it focus on the **simplicity** and **easy-to-use**.
It can be used by a container running inside a VM.
So experiments can be performed in a lightweight container-based emulator (e.g. [ComNetsEmu](https://bitbucket.org/comnets/comnetsemu/src/master/)) on a **single** laptop.

In order to test the latest useful features, this library try to use the latest release of DPDK and XDP.
So it is not stable and experimental.

## Build Shared Library ##

In order to simplify and the build process on different platforms.
The Docker container is suggested and used in this project to build the shared library.
There is a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and a [Python3 script](./util/run_dev_container.py) to automate the build process.
Make sure you have Docker CE installed. The container image and shared library (.so file) can be built with following steps:
(Because DPDK is compiled from the source code, the step of build the container image takes time.)

```bash
$ cd ./util/
# Build the development Docker image with all dependencies installed.
$ ./run_dev_container.py build_image
# Build the shared lib INSIDE the development container.
$ ./run_dev_container.py build_lib
```
By default, when image is built, all files in the source directory are copied into Docker container under /ffpp directory.
So the built image with name ffpp:latest contains the version of source files when image is built.
In order to avoid re-built the image every time during development, the `build_lib`, `run_test` operations provided by
the `run_dev_container.py` will mount the current source directory to `/ffpp`.
Therefore, the compiled library `libffpp.so` located in [./build](./build) directory is generated with latest source code.
This is just to adapt my personal development workflow, you can simplify modify
[run_dev_container.py](./util/run_dev_container.py) for your use cases.

## Development Guide ##

TODO(Zuo): Add development guide.

### API Documentation ###

The C API documentation is generated by [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).
You can build and open the HTML documents with:

```bash
$ make docs
$ xdg-open docs/html/index.html
```
