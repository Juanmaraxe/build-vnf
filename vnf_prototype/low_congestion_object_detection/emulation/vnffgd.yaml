# VNF Forwarding Graph Descriptor (VNFFGD)
# Ref: https://github.com/openstack/tacker/blob/master/doc/source/contributor/vnffgd_template_description.rst

description:
  VNF forwarding graph descriptor example
  The format used reffers to the OpenStack Tacker's VNFFGD template
  The VNF descriptors are included in the VNFFGD to make it simple to be used for Mininet/Containernet
  Just to make it simpler, the PyYAML package is used here to parse the description directly without Validation.
